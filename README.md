# Future Plans
Hello there, if you're reading this hibiscus is currently just a command handler for the Discord API Wrapper [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris). Plans of a library went out the window into the trash. Rather than being a library it will be turned into a global command handler for any existing js chat wrapper libraries. Or something like that.

### Todo List
- [ ] Finish command handler
- [x] Finalize Todo list
