# hibiscus-lib
Hello there, if you're reading this hibiscus is currently just a command handler for the Discord API Wrapper [Eris](https://abal.moe/Eris). Currently there are no ideas of turning hibiscus into a it's own library (mainly because i never made a library). Maybe in the future or different circumstances, it could become it's own library.

### Todo List
- [ ] Finish command handler
- [ ] Finalize Todo list
